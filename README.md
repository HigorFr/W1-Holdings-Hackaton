# W1 Holdings Hackathon Project

## Overview

This repository contains the web application developed during the hackathon organized by W1 Holdings in collaboration with Hugo Cardoso and João Bonfim. The project was built to meet the challenge requirements within a limited timeframe, focusing on delivering a functional solution.

## Description

The application includes a backend, a frontend, and a database layer, and it provides a preconfigured test user to facilitate evaluation and quick testing.

### Preconfigured Test User
- Email: rodrigo.lima@gmail.com
- Password: strongpassword123

This allows anyone reviewing the project to log in and navigate the core features without needing to register or configure accounts.

## Project Components

- **Frontend**: User interface built with web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to interact with users.
- **Backend**: Server logic and API endpoints managing application data and business rules.
- **Deploy**: Configuration files and scripts necessary for deployment.
- **Database/Backend Logic**: Contains database code (PLpgSQL) and backend scripts supporting persistence and application logic.

## Technologies Used

The project uses a combination of languages and technologies across its components, including:

- PLpgSQL for database procedures and stored logic
- Python for backend services
- HTML and CSS for the frontend user interface
- C++ also appears as a part of system logic
- CMake used for build configuration
- JavaScript for client-side interactivity

This mix demonstrates exposure to full-stack development including database, server, and user interface layers.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the appropriate folders for frontend and backend.
3. Set up the database using the provided SQL scripts or schema definitions.
4. Run backend services to make APIs available.
5. Open the frontend in a browser and log in using the provided test user.
6. Explore and interact with available features.

## Context

This project was developed during a hackathon as a prototype application designed for W1 Holdings clients. The goal was to provide a centralized platform where contractors could visualize key information about their holdings, such as overall status, asset distribution, and total managed wealth. The focus was on validating the concept and core functionalities within a limited development timeframe.


## Notes

- The project is not intended as a production-quality system but as a **rapidly developed prototype** demonstrating fast practical software engineering skills.
- The preconfigured user accelerates testing and review.
